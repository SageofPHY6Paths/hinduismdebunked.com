## Purpose

There is a lack of criticism by atheists about Hinduism. There is a good amount of criticism of Christianity and Islam. Logical criticism by sceptic atheists ("debunking") will help several people, who are starting to have doubts regarding the veracity of the claims made by their religion, to awaken from their **deep dogmatic slumber**. Hinduism like pretty much every other religion has many unscientific and immoral beliefs contained within it. We want to scrutinize them on this website.

This website is not made to spread hatred toward Hindus. We promote **ahiṃsā** and **compassion** on this site. We can hate an ideology but still love the people who follow that ideology just like we can hate a disease but still love the diseased. All religions are diseases and we want to cure the religious people.

This site is especially influenced by <a href="https://skepticsannotatedbible.com" target="_blank">Skeptic's Annotated Bible</a> and <a href="https://wikiislam.net/wiki/Main_Page" target="_blank">WikiIslam.net</a>. Some verses were found from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/EXHINDU" target="_blank">r/EXHINDU</a>. You can find some links to criticism of other religions on the [Other Religions](/other-religions/). You can read the contribution guidelines on the [Contribute page](/contribute/).

If you don't know how to use GitHub to make changes to this website you can directly send any verses you find to me by emailing to [sageofphy6paths@gmail.com](mailto:sageofphy6paths@gmail.com).
