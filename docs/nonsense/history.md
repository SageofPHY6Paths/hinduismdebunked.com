### Ramayana Balakanda sarga 1 shloka 97

>दश वर्ष सहस्राणि दश वर्ष शतानि च \|<br>
रामो राज्यम् उपासित्वा ब्रह्म लोकम् प्रयास्यति \|\| १-१-९७

><a href="https://sanskritdocuments.org/sites/valmikiramayan/baala/sarga1/balasans1.htm#Verse97" target="_blank">sanskritdocuments.org</a>: On reverencing the kingdom for ten thousand years plus another one thousand years, i.e. for a total of **eleven thousand years**, Rama voyages to the abode of Brahma...

><a href="https://www.valmiki.iitk.ac.in/sloka?field_kanda_tid=1&language=dv&field_sarga_value=1" target="_blank">IITK</a>: Rama, reigning the kingdom for eleven thousand years, will attain Brahmaloka.

**Comment**: *This makes no sense what so ever from a historical perspective. The oldest parts of the Ramayana date to between the mid-7th century BCE and the mid-6th century BCE. If you assume Rama died around that time then Rama was ruling from around 11700 BCE. Back then there was no civilisation in India. Indus Valley civilisation started in 3300 BCE. And Indus Valley civilisation was not even a Hindu civilisation. Hinduism came much later.*

### Ramayana Balakanda sarga 20 shloka 10

>षष्टिः वर्ष सहस्राणि जातस्य मम कौशिक \|\| १-२०-१०<br>
कृच्छ्रेण उत्पादितः च अयम् न रामम् नेतुम् अर्हसि \|

><a href="https://sanskritdocuments.org/sites/valmikiramayan/baala/sarga20/balasans20.htm#Verse10" target="_blank">sanskritdocuments.org</a>: **Sixty thousand years** have passed from my [Dasharatha] birth, oh! Vishvamitra, and this Rama is engendered at this age, that too with tribulations, hence taking Rama with you will be inappropriate of you.

><a href="https://www.valmiki.iitk.ac.in/sloka?field_kanda_tid=1&language=dv&field_sarga_value=20" target="_blank">IITK</a>: O scion of of Kusika family, sixty thousand years have passed since I was born. Rama was born to me after a great deal of suffering. It is not proper to take him with you.

When, however, **a thousand years according to the calculation of gods had elapsed**, then the great river Ganga having assumed a material form, manifested to him her (divine) self.'
