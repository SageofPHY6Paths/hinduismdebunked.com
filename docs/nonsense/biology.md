### Ramayana Balakanda sarga 1 shloka 97
{: .no_toc }
>दश वर्ष सहस्राणि दश वर्ष शतानि च \|<br>
रामो राज्यम् उपासित्वा ब्रह्म लोकम् प्रयास्यति \|\| १-१-९७

><a href="https://sanskritdocuments.org/sites/valmikiramayan/baala/sarga1/balasans1.htm#Verse97" target="_blank">sanskritdocuments.org</a>: On reverencing the kingdom for ten thousand years plus another one thousand years, i.e. for a total of **eleven thousand years**, Rama voyages to the abode of Brahma...

><a href="https://www.valmiki.iitk.ac.in/sloka?field_kanda_tid=1&language=dv&field_sarga_value=1" target="_blank">IITK</a>: Rama, reigning the kingdom for eleven thousand years, will attain Brahmaloka.

**Comment**: *Humans cannot live for 1000s of years. I too would like if it was possible. But that is biologically a stupid fantacy.*

### Ramayana Balakanda sarga 20 shloka 10
{: .no_toc }
>षष्टिः वर्ष सहस्राणि जातस्य मम कौशिक \|\| १-२०-१०<br>
कृच्छ्रेण उत्पादितः च अयम् न रामम् नेतुम् अर्हसि \|

><a href="https://sanskritdocuments.org/sites/valmikiramayan/baala/sarga20/balasans20.htm#Verse10" target="_blank">sanskritdocuments.org</a>: **Sixty thousand years** have passed from my [Dasharatha] birth, oh! Vishvamitra, and this Rama is engendered at this age, that too with tribulations, hence taking Rama with you will be inappropriate of you.

><a href="https://www.valmiki.iitk.ac.in/sloka?field_kanda_tid=1&language=dv&field_sarga_value=20" target="_blank">IITK</a>: O scion of of Kusika family, sixty thousand years have passed since I was born. Rama was born to me after a great deal of suffering. It is not proper to take him with you.

## Mahabharata

### MB Book 3 Vana Parva Tirtha-yatra Parva Section CVIII
{: .no_toc }

><a href="https://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m03/m03108.htm" target="_blank">sacred-texts.com</a>: And for one thousand years his subsistence was nothing but water, fruit and roots. When, however, **a thousand years according to the calculation of gods had elapsed**, then the great river Ganga having assumed a material form, manifested to him her (divine) self.'

**Comment**: *Bhagiratha did this for 1000 years according to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindu_units_of_time" target="_blank">deva or god years</a>. 1,000 deva yr = 360,000 human yr.*

## Upanishads

## Puranas

### Bhagavata Purana or Srimad Bhagavatam

##### SB 6.9.9
{: .no_toc }
>शश्वत्कामवरेणांहस्तुरीयं जगृहु: स्त्रिय: ।<br>
रजोरूपेण तास्वंहो मासि मासि प्रद‍ृश्यते ॥ ९ ॥

Translations:

> <a href="https://www.srimadbhagavatam.org/canto6/chapter9.html#Text_9" target="_blank">srimadbhagavatam.org</a>: The [youthful] women being blessed with a constant sexual appetite accepted as their quarter of the burden of sin the monthly period as the visible reaction.

> <a href="https://vedabase.io/en/library/sb/6/9/9/" target="_blank">Vedabase</a>: In return for Lord Indra’s benediction that they would be able to enjoy lusty desires continuously, even during pregnancy for as long as sex is not injurious to the embryo, women accepted one fourth of the sinful reactions. As a result of those reactions, women manifest the signs of menstruation every month.

**Comment**: *WOMEN you can not cry from pain each month for being on periods, you traded them with INDRA for being more lusty.*
