Lord Śiva said:—

45. O gods, O sages, you listen to my words with reverence. If my penis is supported in a vaginal passage there will be happiness.

46. Except Pārvatī, no other woman can hold my penis. Held by her my penis will immediately become quiet.

Sūta said:—

47. O great sages, on hearing those words the delighted sages and the gods took Brahmā with them and prayed to Pārvatī.

48. After propitiating Pārvatī and the bull-bannered lord and performing the rites mentioned before, the excellent penis became static.

49. The gods and the sages propitiated Pārvatī and Śiva by the mode of procedure laid down in the Vedas for the sake of virtue.

50. Brahmā, Viṣṇu and other gods, sages and the three worlds including the mobile and immobile beings worshipped Śiva particularly.

51. Śiva became delighted and so also Pārvatī, the mother of the universe. That phallus was held by her in that form then.

52. When the phallus was stabilised, there was welfare throughout the worlds. O brahmins, that phallus became famous in the three worlds.

53. The phallus is known as “Hāṭeśa” as well as “Śivā-Śiva.” By worshipping it, all the people become happy in every respect. <a href="https://www.wisdomlib.org/hinduism/book/shiva-purana-english/d/doc226513.html" target="_blank">wisdomlib.org</a>
