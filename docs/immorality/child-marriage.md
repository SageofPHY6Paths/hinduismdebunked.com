>11. Let him give his daughter, while she still goes naked, to a man who has not broken the vow of chastity and who possesses good qualities, or even to one destitute of good qualities; let him not keep (the maiden) in (his house) after she has reached the age of puberty.
>
>12. He who does not give away a marriageable daughter during three years doubtlessly contracts a guilt equal to (that of) destroying an embryo.
>
>13. Such will be the case if anybody asks her in marriage, and also if nobody demands her. Manu has declared that at each appearance of the menses (the father incurs the guilt of) a mortal sin.
>
>14. Three years let a marriageable damsel wait for the order of her father. But after (that) time let her choose for herself in the fourth year a husband (of) equal (rank). If no man (of) equal (rank) be found, she may take even one destitute of good qualities. <a href="https://www.hinduwebsite.com/sacredscripts/hinduism/dharma/baudh3.asp#4.1" target="_blank">hinduwebsite.com</a>

## Ramayana

### Ramayana Aranya Kanda sarga 47 shloka 10

> मम भर्तामहातेजा वयसा पञ्चविंशकः।।3.47.10।।<br>
अष्टादश हि वर्षाणि मम जन्मनि गण्यते।

><a href="https://sanskritdocuments.org/sites/valmikiramayan/aranya/sarga47/aranyasans47.htm#Verse10" target="_blank">sanskritdocuments.org</a>: My great-resplendent husband was of twenty-five years of age at that time, and to me eighteen years are reckoned up from my birth.

><a href="https://www.valmiki.iitk.ac.in/sloka?field_kanda_tid=3&language=dv&field_sarga_value=47" target="_blank">IITK</a>: My husband who was very bold was twentyfive years and I had completed eighteen years since my birth.

**Comment**: *These are their ages at the start of their exile. In [Sundara Kanda 33.17-18](#ramayana-sundara-kanda-sarga-33-shloka-17-to-18) Sita says that they lived 12 years in the palace after marriage and before exile. So their ages at marriage were 25-12=13 and 18-12=6. This is similar to the values in [SkP 3.2.30.8 to 9](#skp-32308-to-9). The only difference is that Rama's age at marriage is 13 in Ramayana and 15 in Skanda Purana. Since Ramayana is more popular I assume people will believe in the 13 number. But both agree on Sita's age at marriage as 6. Coincidentally [Aisha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aisha){:target="_blank"}'s age at marriage was also 6.*
