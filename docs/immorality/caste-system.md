# Caste System
{: .no_toc }
Caste system is like the Indian version of racism. If you thought the colour of your skin is a very random parameter to determine your worth, you will be shocked because the Indian caste system is even more arbitrary.

## Vedas

### Rig Veda

##### RV 10.90.11 
{: .no_toc }
>यत्पुरु॑षं॒ व्यद॑धुः कति॒धा व्य॑कल्पयन् । मुखं॒ किम॑स्य॒ कौ बा॒हू का ऊ॒रू पादा॑ उच्येते ॥<br>
यत्पुरुषं व्यदधुः कतिधा व्यकल्पयन् । मुखं किमस्य कौ बाहू का ऊरू पादा उच्येते ॥

Translations:

> <a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Rig_Veda/Mandala_10/Hymn_90" target="_blank">Griffith</a>: When they divided Purusa how many portions did they make?<br>
> What do they call his mouth, his arms? What do they call his thighs and feet?

> <a href="https://www.wisdomlib.org/hinduism/book/rig-veda-english-translation/d/doc839609.html" target="_blank">Wilson</a>: When they immolated Puruṣa, into how many portions did they divide him? What was his mouth called, what his arms, what his thighs, what were his feet called?

##### RV 10.90.12
{: .no_toc }
> ब्रा॒ह्म॒णो॑ऽस्य॒ मुख॑मासीद्बा॒हू रा॑ज॒न्य॑: कृ॒तः । ऊ॒रू तद॑स्य॒ यद्वैश्य॑: प॒द्भ्यां शू॒द्रो अ॑जायत ॥<br>
ब्राह्मणोऽस्य मुखमासीद्बाहू राजन्यः कृतः । ऊरू तदस्य यद्वैश्यः पद्भ्यां शूद्रो अजायत ॥

> <a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Rig_Veda/Mandala_10/Hymn_90" target="_blank">Griffith</a>: The Brahman was his mouth, of both his arms was the Rajanya made.<br>
>His thighs became the Vaisya, from his feet the Sudra was produced.

> <a href="https://www.wisdomlib.org/hinduism/book/rig-veda-english-translation/d/doc839610.html" target="_blank">Wilson</a>: His mouth became the Brāhmaṇa, his arms became the Rājanya, his thighs became the Vaiśya;the Śūdra was born from his feet.

**Comment**: *This was written in 1500–1000 BCE. So caste system was not invented by Britishers to divide Indians after all.*

## Bhagavad Gita

### BG 4.13
{: .no_toc }
>चातुर्वर्ण्यं मया सृष्टं गुणकर्मविभागशः ।<br>
तस्य कर्तारमपि मां विद्ध्यकर्तारमव्ययम् ॥ १३ ॥

Translations:

><a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bhagavad-Gita_(Besant_4th)/Discourse_4" target="_blank">Besant</a>: The four castes were emanated by Me, by the different distribution of qualities and actions; know Me to be the author of them, though the actionless and inexhaustible.

><a href="https://vedabase.io/en/library/bg/4/13/" target="_blank">As It Is</a>: According to the three modes of material nature and the work associated with them, the four divisions of human society are created by Me. And although I am the creator of this system, you should know that I am yet the nondoer, being unchangeable.

**Comment**: *It is not at all surprising that whoever wrote these things kept their own division at the top. These type of arrogance by the makers of religions is common in religions. For example <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews_as_the_chosen_people" target="_blank">Jews think they are the chosen people</a>.*

### BG 18.47
{: .no_toc }
>श्रेयान्स्वधर्मो विगुण: परधर्मात्स्वनुष्ठितात् ।<br>
स्वभावनियतं कर्म कुर्वन्नाप्‍नोति किल्बिषम् ॥ ४७ ॥

Translations:

><a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bhagavad-Gita_(Besant_4th)/Discourse_18" target="_blank">Besant</a>: Better is one's own duty though destitute of merits than the well-executed duty of another. He who doeth the duty laid down by his own nature incurreth not sin.

><a href="https://vedabase.io/en/library/bg/18/47/" target="_blank">As It Is</a>: It is better to engage in one’s own occupation, even though one may perform it imperfectly, than to accept another’s occupation and perform it perfectly. Duties prescribed according to one’s nature are never affected by sinful reactions.

**Comment**: *Hindus often say that as per the actual Hinduism the verna system is not hereditary and it is just a hierarchy given based on their job. They blame either Manusmṛiti or the British colonial rule in India as the cause of why caste system became hereditary. But that is false even in the most authoritative books of Hinduism like Bhagavad Gita caste system is hereditary. If you don't follow your caste occupation you are a sinner according to Hinduism. Whoever wrote these things (Hindus believe these are spoken by Krishna but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krishna#Historical_and_literary_sources" target="_blank">Krishna</a> is a fictional character made of an amalgamation of several independent deities) wanted their descendants to be forever doing the easy and high paying jobs and wanted the poor to remain poor forever.*

>मां हि पार्थ व्यपाश्रित्य येऽपि स्यु: पापयोनय: ।<br>

Translations:

><a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bhagavad-Gita_(Besant_4th)/Discourse_9" target="_blank">Besant</a>: They who take refuge with Me, O Partha, though of the womb of sin, women, Vaishyas, even Shûdras, they also tread the highest path.

><a href="https://vedabase.io/en/library/bg/9/32/" target="_blank">As It Is</a>: O son of Pṛthā, those who take shelter in Me, though they be of lower birth – women, vaiśyas [merchants] and śūdras [workers] – can attain the supreme destination.

><a href="https://vedabase.io/en/library/bg/18/41/" target="_blank">As It Is</a>: Brāhmaṇas, kṣatriyas, vaiśyas and śūdras are distinguished by the qualities born of their own natures in accordance with the material modes, O chastiser of the enemy.

ज्ञानं विज्ञानमास्तिक्यं ब्रह्मकर्म स्वभावजम् ॥ ४२ ॥

Translations:

><a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bhagavad-Gita_(Besant_4th)/Discourse_18" target="_blank">Besant</a>:  Serenity, self-restraint, austerity, purity, forgiveness and also uprightness, wisdom, knowledge, belief in God, are the Brâhmana duty, born of his own nature.

>वैश्यस्तु वार्तावृत्ति: स्यान्नित्यं ब्रह्मकुलानुग: ।<br>
शूद्रस्य द्विजशुश्रूषा वृत्तिश्च स्वामिनो भवेत् ॥ १५ ॥

Translations:

> <a href="https://www.srimadbhagavatam.org/canto7/chapter11.html#Text_15" target="_blank">srimadbhagavatam.org</a>: The vais'yas [the merchants] are to be engaged in their occupational activities [of farming and trading] and should always follow what the brahmins teach, while the **s'ûdras [the laborers] for their livelihood have to accept the three types of twice-born souls as their masters to serve.**

> <a href="https://vedabase.io/en/library/sb/7/11/15/" target="_blank">Vedabase</a>: The mercantile community should always follow the directions of the brāhmaṇas and engage in such occupational duties as agriculture, trade, and protection of cows. **For the śūdras the only duty is to accept a master from a higher social order and engage in his service.**

**Comment**: *So, Shudras' only duty as per this immoral and nonsensical religion is to serve someone from higher caste.*

##### SB 11.17.49
{: .no_toc }

कृच्छ्रान्मुक्तो न गर्ह्येण वृत्तिं लिप्सेत कर्मणा ॥ ४९ ॥

> <a href="https://vedabase.io/en/library/sb/11/17/49/" target="_blank">Vedabase</a>: A vaiśya, or mercantile man, who cannot maintain himself may adopt the occupation of a śūdra, and a śūdra who cannot find a master can engage in simple activities like making baskets and mats of straw. However, all members of society who have adopted inferior occupations in emergency situations must give up those substitute occupations when the difficulties have passed.

**Comment**: *Again it is a hereditary thing. Only in emergency times you can change your jobs.*
##### SB 6.18.49
