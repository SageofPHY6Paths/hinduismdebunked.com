><a href="https://sanskritdocuments.org/sites/valmikiramayan/ayodhya/sarga52/ayodhyasans52.htm#Verse102" target="_blank">sanskritdocuments.org</a>: Having **hunted** there four deer, namely Varaaha, Rishya, Prisata; and Mahaaruru (the four principal species of deer) and taking quickly the portions that were pure, being hungry as they were, Rama and Lakshmana reached a tree to take rest in the evening.

><a href="https://www.valmiki.iitk.ac.in/sloka?field_kanda_tid=2&language=dv&field_sarga_value=52" target="_blank">IITK</a>: Famished, they (Rama and Lakshmana) **killed** a boar, a rishya (whitefooted male antelope), a spotted deer and a great deer with black stripes. They partook the meat and reached a tree by evening where they rested for the night.

**Comment**: *Why is he killing animals? Don't say he needs it to survive. Bhagiratha a mere human being <a href="https://hinduismdebunked.com/nonsense/history/#mb-book-3-vana-parva-tirtha-yatra-parva-section-cviii" target="_blank">was able to live 1000 deva years without food</a> in Hindu fiction. Rama was a god in human avatar, he should be able to live for even more years. Even if for some reason he needs food why can't he do some plant agriculture?

>त्रयोदश्यामथो विष्णो: स्‍नपनं पञ्चकैर्विभो: ।<br>
कारयेच्छास्त्रद‍ृष्टेन विधिना विधिकोविदै: ॥ ५० ॥

Translations:

> <a href="https://www.srimadbhagavatam.org/canto8/chapter16.html#Text_50" target="_blank">srimadbhagavatam.org</a>: Next on the thirteenth day proceeding in accordance with the regulations as laid down in the scriptures, the Almighty One [Vishnu] should be bathed with five substances [**milk, yogurt, ghee,** sugar and **honey**].

> <a href="https://vedabase.io/en/library/sb/8/16/50/" target="_blank">Vedabase</a>: Thereafter, following the directions of the śāstra with help from brāhmaṇas who know the śāstra, on the thirteenth day of the moon one should bathe Lord Viṣṇu with five substances [**milk, yogurt, ghee**, sugar and **honey**].

**Comment**: *Come on Viṣṇu, you want your statues to be bathed in milk, yogurt, ghee, and honey. Each of the mentioned products are nonvegan and require animal cruelty. Even though, today it is immoral to consume dairy products, I don't think it was morally wrong for people who lived before B12 fortified foods and supplements were available to consume dairy products (meat wasn't necessary even in those days. Jains followed vegetarianism from thousands of years). But for beings like Viṣṇu (moral standards can be measured even for fictional characters like Viṣṇu) who do not have nutritional needs unlike us it is immoral to consume these dairy products even before B12 fortified foods and supplements were available. They can live without taking away the milk that was supposed to be for the calf. Too much hypocrisy (cowpocrisy?) for a religion that says cows are sacred. There is nothing holy about forcefully inseminating cows and taking away the milk from the calf.*

>पूजां च महतीं कुर्याद् वित्तशाठ्यविवर्जित: ।<br>

सूक्तेन तेन पुरुषं यजेत सुसमाहित: ।<br>

Translations:

> <a href="https://www.srimadbhagavatam.org/canto8/chapter16.html#Text_51-52" target="_blank">srimadbhagavatam.org</a>: By reciting the many hymns [or sûkta] for Lord Vishnu who resides in the hearts of all, the miserly mentality [of not spending] must be given up to the offerings of the **milk** and grains in grand worship. With great attention one thus should worship the Original Personality with the offerings of the food that was so carefully prepared to please His person.

> <a href="https://vedabase.io/en/library/sb/8/16/51-52/" target="_blank">Vedabase</a>: Giving up the miserly habit of not spending money, one should arrange for the gorgeous worship of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Viṣṇu, who is situated in the heart of every living entity. With great attention, one must prepare an oblation of grains boiled in **ghee and milk** and must chant the Puruṣa-sūkta mantra. The offerings of food should be of varieties of tastes. In this way, one should worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

Translations:

> <a href="https://www.srimadbhagavatam.org/canto11/chapter12.html#Text_18" target="_blank">srimadbhagavatam.org</a>: Just as fire confined within wood, with the help of air, kindled by friction is born very tiny and increases with **ghee**, I similarly manifest Myself in this [Vedic, inner] voice.

> <a href="https://vedabase.io/en/library/sb/11/12/18/" target="_blank">Vedabase</a>: When sticks of kindling wood are vigorously rubbed together, heat is produced by contact with air, and a spark of fire appears. Once the fire is kindled, **ghee** is added and the fire blazes. Similarly, I become manifest in the sound vibration of the Vedas.
