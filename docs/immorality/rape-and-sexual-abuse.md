>Sûta then said :-- “O Dvija! While Sûrasena's daughter Kunti was a virgin girl, the king Kuntibhoja asked for Kunti that she might become her girl and Sûrasena gave her to the king Kuntibhoja who brought up this beautifully smiling girl. He put to her the service of Agni of Agnihotra. Once, on an occassion, Durvâsâ Muni, engaged in the vow, lasting for four months, came there; Kunti served him during that period; the Muni became greatly pleased and gave her a very auspicious, mantra, by virtue of which any Deva, when called upon by that mantra will come to Kunti and satisfy her desires. When the Muni went away, Kunti, remaining in her house, wanted to test the accuracy of the mantra and asked within herself  “What Devatâ to call upon.” Seeing the God Sûrya had arisen in the sky, Kunti uttered the Mantra and invoked him. The Sun, then, assuming an excellent human form, came down from the Heavens and appeared before Kunti in the same room. Seeing the Deva Sun, Kunti became greatly surprised and began to shudder and instantly became endowed with the inherent natural quality of passion (had menstruation). The beautiful-eyed Kunti, with folded palm; spoke to Sûrya Deva standing before :-- “I am highly pleased to-day seeing Thy form; now go back to Thy sphere.”
>
>Sûrya Deva said :-- “O Kunti! What for you called me, by virtue of the Mantra? Calling me, why do you not worship me, standing before you? O beautiful blue one! Seeing you, I have become passionate; so come to me. By means of the mantra, you have made me your subservient **so take me for intercourse**.” Hearing this, Kunti said :-- **“O Witness of all! O knower of Dharma! You know that I am a virgin girl. O Suvrata! I bow down to you; I am a family daughter; so do not speak ill to me.”** Sûrya then said :-- “If I go away in vain, I will be an object of great shame, and, no doubt, will be laughed amongst the gods; So, O Kunti! **If you do not satisfy me, I will immediately curse you and the Brâhmin who has given you this mantra**. O Beautiful one! If you satisfy me, your virginity will remain; no body will come to know and there will be born a son to you, exactly like me.” Thus saying **Sûrya Deva enjoyed the bashful Kunti**, with her mind attracted towards him; He granted her the desired boons and went away. The beautiful Kunti became pregnant and began to remain in a house, under great secrecy. Only the dear nurse knew that; her mother or any other person was quite unaware of the fact. In time, a very beautiful son like the second Sun and Kârtikeya, decked with a lovely Kavacha coat of mail and two ear-rings, was born there. <a href="https://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/db/bk02ch06.htm" target="_blank">sacred-texts.com</a>

>
>1-7. Thereafter, O king, one should go to the excellent Ahalyeśvara Tīrtha where the blessed ascetic lady Ahalyā received redemption and fulfilment formerly.
>
>There was a Brāhmaṇa named Gautama who was like another Brahmā. He was endowed with truthfulness and piety. He was engrossed in the Vānaprastha stage of life.
>
>His blessed wife named Ahalyā was very famous in all the three worlds as a woman endowed with beauty and prime of youth.
>
>Śatakratu, the king of Devas, **was infatuated by the exceptional beauty of Ahalyā**. The Slayer of Bala, therefore, tempted her.
>
>“O beautiful lady of uncensured features, resort to me, the king of Devas. Sport about with me. You shall be one honoured in all the three worlds. What will you do with this Brāhmaṇa who has become lean and emaciated due to his over-zealous-ness for purity and conventional rites and austerities and Vedic studies! O lady of beautiful eyes, you must be rather undergoing sufferings now.”
>
>On being told thus, the beautiful lady, very fickle by nature as all women are, became confused and defiled by the god of Love. Mentally she became overwhelmed by Śakra.
>
>8-16. Sensing her emotional upheaval the Lord who slew Pāka was so overcome by wicked intentions that he deceived Gautama.
>
>Getting an opportunity, **he assumed the excellent guise of the sage and carnally delighted Ahalyā who believed (that he was Gautama) in the inner apartment**.
>
>Within a moment thereafter, O descendant of Bharata, the excellent sage hurriedly entered the apartment.
>
>On seeing Gautama come Purandara became terrified and he went out. Seeing him he thought (knew) that it was Śakra. So Gautama became highly enraged and he cursed Devendra: “Since you could not control your senses, be one with a thousand vaginal apertures.” On being cursed thus, Devendra was instantly **covered with a thousand vaginal apertures**. He became bereft of all glory. He left the kingdom and the Suras too. He performed elaborate penance on the earth. <a href="https://www.wisdomlib.org/hinduism/book/the-skanda-purana/d/doc425865.html" target="_blank">wisdomlib.org</a>

>0 Narada, thereafter lord Visnu enjoyed the company of the damsel. TulasI felt more delighted than before and she ultimately came to know about the reality and said: “Who are you”?
>
>TulasI said—“Are you not the lord of illusion”? You tell me who you are? **You have deceitfully enjoyed my company and have defiled my chastity.** Therefore I shall pronounce a **curse on you**. O Rrahmana, getting afraid of the curse of TulasI, lord Visnii playfully took to an extremely charming form. The queen saw that the lord of all the lords was standing before her who had the complexion of a new cloud, had the eyes like the lotuses of the winter season, had a beautiful body containing crores of gods of love, adorned with all ornaments, wearing a smile on his face and clad in a yellow lower garment.
>
>Finding him there, lustful TulasI fainted with passion. On regaining consciousness she spoke.
>
>TulasI said—O lord, you are heartless, having no compassion. You are hard like a stone. **You have defiled my chastity deceitfully and have killed my husband.**
>
>O lord, therefore you are stone-hearted and devoid of compassion. You will therefore take the form of a stone on earth.

>Reaching there she narrated the entire story to the sage Gautama laughingly denounced Indra very much. Soon thereafter Gautama went to Siva, in the meantime **Indra impersonating himself as Gautama enjoyed the company of Ahalya.**
>
>The all knowledgeable sage came to know about everything and immediately returned to his abode. Gatuama the best of the sages spotted Indra moving out of his hermitage and also found **Ahalya having the developed pelvic region and the breasts, lying unrobed there.** The sage then pronounced a curse on Indra, **"You will have yonis all through your body"**. In anger he pronounced a **curse also on the terrified and crying Ahalya**, 'Tn the thick forest you will be turned into a stone". After getting immensely ashamed Indra went to his abode but the terrified Ahalya with her mind filled with grief spoke sweet words to Gautama. <a href="https://archive.org/details/brahma-vaivarta-purana-all-four-kandas-english-translation" target="_blank">PDF</a> (Page - 433)

>Tara said- O moon you leave me, O blemish for the gods, leave me alone. I happen to be the **wife of your teacher and also the daughter of a Brahmana**, I have always been chaste and virtuous. One has to earn the sin of hundred Brahmahaty&s by cohabiting with the wife of a teacher. If the wife of a teacher happens to be the daughter of a Brahmana and a chaste one, cohabiting with her earns the sins of a thousand Brahmahatyds.
>
>Therefore, lord of gods, you be patient, look **I happen to be your mother and you happen to be my son**. In case you indulge in such a type of deplorable action, you will earn disgrace and on hearing this Brhaspati, the teacher of the gods would reduce you to ashes. You happen to be the **pupil of my husband and are dear to him like his own son**. Therefore, sinful one, don't indulge in this. You leave the mother like me free and protect the dharma and in case you would touch me again I shall shower on you the sin of the killing of a woman. The moon a on the other hand, did not listen to the words of TSra and got **ready to cohabit with her**. At this Tara who was free from passion and was quite chaste, became enraged and pronounced a curse on him, "You would be **eclipsed by Rahu**, covered with the clouds and would be quite sinful to look at. You would be filled with blemish and suffer from the disease of consumption. There is no doubt about it.".
>
>Thus pronouncing a curse on the moon she also pronounced a curse on the god of love, "You would be reduced to ashes by an illustrious person. O lord of Vraja, **thereafter the moon caught hold of Tara and enjoyed her company who was crying and sobbing**. He took her in his lap and moved from that place. <a href="https://archive.org/details/brahma-vaivarta-purana-all-four-kandas-english-translation" target="_blank">PDF</a> (Page - 516)

Suta said : — Bfihaspati, whilst slaying on Earth, one day saw the wife of his brother, Wija, who was big Avith child, and addressed her thus: — “ Dress thj'sclf well and let us enjoy.” She, being thus addressed, replied to Brihaspati thus : — ” Tlie embryo in my womb is mature and is already reciting the Vedas, Thy seed will also not be fruitless and thy proposal is sinful.” Hearing which, Bfihaspati said : — ” I need not be taught morality by thee, 0 sweet one.” After saying that, he carried out his desire by force ; when on the verge of his final enjoyment, the child from her womb cried out to Bfihaspati : — ” I have entered the womb first, 0 Bfihaspati, thy seed will also not go in vain. There is no room for a second body in this womb.” Bfihaspati being thus addressed by the child in the womb, replied in anger : — “ Because on such an occasion, dear to every creature, thou preventest me from enjoyment, thou shouldst see lasting darkness [Dirgbatamas].” -17-28.

Afterwards, Bfihaspati cast his seed on the floor which at once became a child ; seeing whom, MamatA said to Bfihaspati, “lam going home, you should support [Bbara] this child [born of us two (dvfija)], 0 Bfihaspati.” — 24-25. <a href="https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.45856/" target="_blank">PDF</a> (Page - 168)
