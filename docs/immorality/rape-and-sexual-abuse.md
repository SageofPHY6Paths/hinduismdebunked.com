Translations:

> <a href="https://www.srimadbhagavatam.org/canto9/chapter24.html#Text_33" target="_blank">srimadbhagavatam.org</a>: When she saw the godhead appearing before her, she was very surprised and said: 'Forgive me, oh godhead, please return, I only engaged this way to check out what it would do!'
>
> [The sun god answered:] 'In order not to be fruitless in your encounter with a godhead, I shall give you a son in your womb and arrange it so, oh my beauty, that you will not be defiled.'
>
>With this promise the sun god made her pregnant and returned to his heavenly abode. Directly thereafter a child was born that looked like a second sun god.

> <a href="https://vedabase.io/en/library/sb/9/24/33/" target="_blank">Vedabase</a>: As soon as Kuntī called for the demigod of the sun, he immediately appeared before her, and she was very much surprised. She told the sun-god, “I was simply examining the effectiveness of this mystic power. I am sorry I have called you unnecessarily. Please return and excuse me.”
>
>The sun-god said: O beautiful Pṛthā, your meeting with the demigods cannot be fruitless. Therefore, let me place my seed in your womb so that you may bear a son. I shall arrange to keep your virginity intact, since you are still an unmarried girl.
>
>After saying this, the sun-god **discharged his semen** into the womb of Pṛthā and then returned to the celestial kingdom. Immediately thereafter, from Kuntī a child was born, who was like a second sun-god.

>Sûta then said :-- “O Dvija! While Sûrasena's daughter Kunti was a virgin girl, the king Kuntibhoja asked for Kunti that she might become her girl and Sûrasena gave her to the king Kuntibhoja who brought up this beautifully smiling girl. He put to her the service of Agni of Agnihotra. Once, on an occassion, Durvâsâ Muni, engaged in the vow, lasting for four months, came there; Kunti served him during that period; the Muni became greatly pleased and gave her a very auspicious, mantra, by virtue of which any Deva, when called upon by that mantra will come to Kunti and satisfy her desires. When the Muni went away, Kunti, remaining in her house, wanted to test the accuracy of the mantra and asked within herself  “What Devatâ to call upon.” Seeing the God Sûrya had arisen in the sky, Kunti uttered the Mantra and invoked him. The Sun, then, assuming an excellent human form, came down from the Heavens and appeared before Kunti in the same room. Seeing the Deva Sun, Kunti became greatly surprised and began to shudder and instantly became endowed with the inherent natural quality of passion (had menstruation). The beautiful-eyed Kunti, with folded palm; spoke to Sûrya Deva standing before :-- “I am highly pleased to-day seeing Thy form; now go back to Thy sphere.”
>
>Sûrya Deva said :-- “O Kunti! What for you called me, by virtue of the Mantra? Calling me, why do you not worship me, standing before you? O beautiful blue one! Seeing you, I have become passionate; so come to me. By means of the mantra, you have made me your subservient **so take me for intercourse**.” Hearing this, Kunti said :-- **“O Witness of all! O knower of Dharma! You know that I am a virgin girl. O Suvrata! I bow down to you; I am a family daughter; so do not speak ill to me.”** Sûrya then said :-- “If I go away in vain, I will be an object of great shame, and, no doubt, will be laughed amongst the gods; So, O Kunti! **If you do not satisfy me, I will immediately curse you and the Brâhmin who has given you this mantra**. O Beautiful one! If you satisfy me, your virginity will remain; no body will come to know and there will be born a son to you, exactly like me.” Thus saying **Sûrya Deva enjoyed the bashful Kunti**, with her mind attracted towards him; He granted her the desired boons and went away. The beautiful Kunti became pregnant and began to remain in a house, under great secrecy. Only the dear nurse knew that; her mother or any other person was quite unaware of the fact. In time, a very beautiful son like the second Sun and Kârtikeya, decked with a lovely Kavacha coat of mail and two ear-rings, was born there. <a href="https://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/db/bk02ch06.htm" target="_blank">sacred-texts.com</a>

>Śrī Mārkaṇḍeya said:
>
>1-7. Thereafter, O king, one should go to the excellent Ahalyeśvara Tīrtha where the blessed ascetic lady Ahalyā received redemption and fulfilment formerly.
>
>There was a Brāhmaṇa named Gautama who was like another Brahmā. He was endowed with truthfulness and piety. He was engrossed in the Vānaprastha stage of life.
>
>His blessed wife named Ahalyā was very famous in all the three worlds as a woman endowed with beauty and prime of youth.
>
>Śatakratu, the king of Devas, **was infatuated by the exceptional beauty of Ahalyā**. The Slayer of Bala, therefore, tempted her.
>
>“O beautiful lady of uncensured features, resort to me, the king of Devas. Sport about with me. You shall be one honoured in all the three worlds. What will you do with this Brāhmaṇa who has become lean and emaciated due to his over-zealous-ness for purity and conventional rites and austerities and Vedic studies! O lady of beautiful eyes, you must be rather undergoing sufferings now.”
>
>On being told thus, the beautiful lady, very fickle by nature as all women are, became confused and defiled by the god of Love. Mentally she became overwhelmed by Śakra.
>
>8-16. Sensing her emotional upheaval the Lord who slew Pāka was so overcome by wicked intentions that he deceived Gautama.
>
>Getting an opportunity, **he assumed the excellent guise of the sage and carnally delighted Ahalyā who believed (that he was Gautama) in the inner apartment**.
>
>Within a moment thereafter, O descendant of Bharata, the excellent sage hurriedly entered the apartment.
>
>On seeing Gautama come Purandara became terrified and he went out. Seeing him he thought (knew) that it was Śakra. So Gautama became highly enraged and he cursed Devendra: “Since you could not control your senses, be one with a thousand vaginal apertures.” On being cursed thus, Devendra was instantly **covered with a thousand vaginal apertures**. He became bereft of all glory. He left the kingdom and the Suras too. He performed elaborate penance on the earth. <a href="https://www.wisdomlib.org/hinduism/book/the-skanda-purana/d/doc425865.html" target="_blank">wisdomlib.org</a>

>Reaching there she narrated the entire story to the sage Gautama laughingly denounced Indra very much. Soon thereafter Gautama went to Siva, in the meantime **Indra impersonating himself as Gautama enjoyed the company of Ahalya.**
>
>The all knowledgeable sage came to know about everything and immediately returned to his abode. Gatuama the best of the sages spotted Indra moving out of his hermitage and also found **Ahalya having the developed pelvic region and the breasts, lying unrobed there.** The sage then pronounced a curse on Indra, **"You will have yonis all through your body"**. In anger he pronounced a **curse also on the terrified and crying Ahalya**, 'Tn the thick forest you will be turned into a stone". After getting immensely ashamed Indra went to his abode but the terrified Ahalya with her mind filled with grief spoke sweet words to Gautama. <a href="https://archive.org/details/brahma-vaivarta-purana-all-four-kandas-english-translation" target="_blank">PDF</a> (Page - 433)
